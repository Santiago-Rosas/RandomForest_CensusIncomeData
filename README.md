# Random Forest With Census Income Data Set 
In this analysis we use a random forest model to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data of the uci

### Workflow:
- Data summary
- Visualization of missing values
- Data transformation
- Undersampling
- Random Forest Model 
- Evaluation of Model 
- GridSearchCV to find the better parameters (n_estimators)
