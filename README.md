# Random Forest With Census Income Data Set 
In this analysis we use a random forest model to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data of the uci

Workflow:
1 . Data summary
2. Visualization of missing values
3. Data transformation
4. Undersampling
5. Random Forest Model 
6. Evaluation of Model 
7. GridSearchCV to find the better parameters (n_estimators)
